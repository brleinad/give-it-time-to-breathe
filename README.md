## Usage

After installing (for now install as per Local Development instructions).
Whenever you want to remind yourself to give it a little time to breath just active the extension by clicking on it and checking the checkbox.

Once active whenever you hit the 'Merge' button you will get a quick reminder for one day.

After one day the extension will stop reminding so if you will have to reactivate it again if needed.
